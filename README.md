# PyHTML
<h2>General Idea :</h2>
Implement HTML code using python, with giving the logic of programming - used in python - such that loops, conditions, variables ... etc.  
<h2>Fondation of the project :</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OOP in python.</li>
    <li>Relations between files, each one is as same important as the other one when we use the project.</li>
    <li>Two ways to implement and run the program</li>
</ul>
<h2>Different ways to implement :</h2>
<ol type='A'>
    <li>Run the 'intrept.py' file with write '#start' and '#end' at the end and begginnig of code;look at the images folder and 'WithIntrept.py' file to understand more.</li>
    <li>Store each code structure in variables and then use the functions run&save -from 'oop.py',
    ;look at the images folder and 'WithVars.py' file to understand more.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The benifits of this project :</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Good way to create webpages using python for those who hate html jjj. </li>
    <li>In second way, you can use programming basics like conditions and loops in create the pages.</li>
    <li>Trying to edit on the code is good way that help you think better to solve problems and understand more the basics.</li>
</ul>
